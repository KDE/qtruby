* The code strings for methods like QVERIFY are now evaluated in the context
of the test function that they are in. A trace_func_proc is used to trap each
call to a test function slot, and the binding is then saved as 
'current_binding' in the Qt::Test class.
* If a method like QVERIFY() fails, the rest of the code in the test function
isn't executed.
* Added an example 'myfirsttest.rb' converted from the C++ version by Jan Pilz.
