* Added command line tool example similar to 'sopranocmd'

* Add port, host, username and password options to the bulk load option for
virtuoso backends with the bulk loading option in the ActiveRDF adapter

* Fixed a bug in the ActiveRDF adapter which meant it wouldn't work with 
activerdf 1.6.11
* Added support for using a backend directly, rather than via a DBus client.
For instance, you can connect to a virtuoso backend like this:

    pool = ConnectionPool.add_data_source :type => :soprano, 
        :backend => 'virtuoso',
        :port => 1113, :host => 'localhost', 
        :password => 'dba', :username => 'dba'

* Note that the port/localhost/password/username options are specific to the
virtuoso backend
* Worked round a bug in the smoke library code generation where optional 
arguments to pure virtual methods aren't supported. StorageModel#executeQuery
will now work with just two arguments.

* Added a marshaller for lists of backend settings

* The Soprano ActiveRDF adapter shouldn't return BNode blank nodes, but should
return nil instead

* Call qRegisterMetatype() on Soprano::Node and Soprano::Statement at start up
so that Qt::Variants can be created with them

* Improved the ActiveRDF adapter
    * Added a ':service' option which defaults to 'org.soprano.Server'
    * The adapter was read-only
    * Fixed bugs in deleting statements from the store
    * Improved the test script, although it still doesn't work very well
* Added inspect and pretty_print methods for Soprano::Statements
* Variable values in a Soprano::BindingSet can be accessed as 'myset[:mykey]'
