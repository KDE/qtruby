Correctly initialize the data uints when constructing a QMetaObject,
and add a signalCount data value (the QMetaObject is still revision
3 which is probably wrong).

Add a dump() method for debugging the QMetaObject construction

When finding the 'inheritanceDistance' for an argument passed to a
method and the expected argument type, look in all the Smoke modules
in the inheritance heirarchy not just the Smoke module for the
argument.
