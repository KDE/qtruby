INTRODUCTION
============

RuBoids is a Boids simulation written in Ruby and using OpenGL and Qt. For
information on Boids, see http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/.

Ruby is an object-oriented scripting language by Yukihiro Matsumoto. The
official Ruby Web site (http://www.ruby-lang.org/) contains information and
pointers to resources for this wonderful language.

RuBoids is developed and maintained by Jim Menard (<jimm@io.com>). The
latest version of RuBoids can be found on the Ruby Application Archive or
on the official RuBoids Web page
(http://www.io.com/~jimm/downloads/ruboids/).

RUNNING
=======

	cd ruboids
	ruboids.rb

RuBoids looks for an optional properties file. If none is specified on the
command line, it looks for a file named 'boids.properties' in the current
directory. For example, to load the example properties file in this
directory:

	cd ruboids
	ruboids.rb ../boids.properties

DEPENDENCIES
============

RuBoids requires the OpenGL and Qt packages, which can be found on the Ruby
Application Archive.
