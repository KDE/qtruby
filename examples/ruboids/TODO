BUGS
====

* Boid rotation.

* Frustum.

TO DO
=====

* Comment the code.

* More documentation.

* Save/restore params (e.g. camera position).

POSSIBLE ADDITIONS
==================

* Make sphere output more efficient by using strips or fans.

* Boids-eye view: camera follows position of a boid. This is not hard, but
  I have to fix boid rotation first.

* Velocity and destination influence proportional to distance from other
  boids. Boids that are farther away have less influence on your velocity
  and destination.

* Boids that are behind you don't influence you because you can't see them.
